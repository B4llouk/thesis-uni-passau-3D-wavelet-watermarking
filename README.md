attacks: 
additive noise as distortion.
 rescaling/stretching 


quality: how much does the watermark distort the image and is it acceptable 

Peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR):
Where Mean Square Error (MSE) is given by the equation (6) as 
2.5.2.Normalized correlation(NC): 







read and understand about different types of wavelets 
automate application (lots of wavelets and different modes) => lots of output data 
save outpyt data and use it later in results 



watermark retrieval: retrieve 3d and go through each one and see to which website they lead 

metrics metrics metrics 
study which signal mode is better ( asymmetric, near symmetric, symmetric)
which number of  vanishing moments is best





create github repository 
see papers 
find logical explanation for multiplication mess up 



3/ Need to establish a concise state of the art 

4/ need to code a process that gets 3D watermark and search for a link by going through all 2D QR codes 

5/ Code tabular results that allow us to have dictionaries as watermarkings results and then compare automatically the metrics 

we can do different transforms, try to perfect the results and compare  => using discret transforms 






Done so far: 
implemented watermark multiplying 
implemented watermark addition 
watermark retrieval 
histograms 
cleaned code with helper scripts 
Data viz 
watermark with wvt
